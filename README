To run the server:

./server.sh <listen_port> <number_of_players>

To run the game on a local machine:

./run.sh <server_port> <server_host_name> <local_listening_port>

The server will block until at least <number_of_players> players joins the game. This can be as many as you want,
but theoretically the more that play the more delay there will be in broadcasting to all players. That being said
I didn't handle the case where you have more players join than <number_of_players>, so behavior in that case
is undefined, and I wouldn't recommend breaking the code that way.

If one player quits, the game will end, but the server will stay alive, and wait for further connections.

If the server is killed (via CTRL-C) then it will signal all connected players that it is about to die and all
players will perceive that someone has left, and end the game.

See comments in teh code for specific details on implementation. The makefile may complain as well, just
ignore it.
